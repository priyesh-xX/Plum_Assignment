# Gnosis: AI-Powered Quizzing Platform

Gnosis is an intelligent, full-stack quizzing platform built for our universityâ€™s quizzing club. It enables users to practice topic-wise quizzes, take AI-generated challenge mode tests, and track their performance through an XP-based gamification system. It is designed for scalability, interactivity, and a seamless quiz experience.

# 1. Project Setup & Demo

### Web
1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/priyesh-xX/Plum_Assignment

Install dependencies and start the project:
cd PlumAssignmentTopic2
npm install
npm start

Frontend:
cd client
npm run dev

Backend:
cd server
node index.js

# 2. Problem Understanding

The goal of this project is to build a quiz platform that leverages AI (OpenAI GPT) to generate dynamic quiz questions for users.
Users can choose Practice Mode or Challenge Mode.
Challenge Mode quizzes are timed and reward XP for correct answers.
Practice Mode allows learning without affecting XP.
AI generates MCQs or descriptive questions dynamically based on the selected topic.

Assumptions:
Users have an active internet connection for AI API calls.
Each quiz question has one correct answer.
XP calculation is based on correct answers only.

# 3.AI Prompts & Iterations

Initial Prompt: Generated descriptive questions with short answers.

Issues: Answers were free-text; evaluation logic often marked correct answers wrong.

Refined Prompt:

Generate MCQs with 4 options (Aâ€“D)

Return JSON:
  [
  { "question": "...", "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "answer": "A" }
  ]

# 6.Known Issues / Improvements

Current Limitations:
Challenge quiz requires stable internet for AI calls.
Evaluation logic is MCQ-based; descriptive answers may need better NLP scoring.
No multiplayer or leaderboard features implemented yet.

Potential Improvements:
Store generated questions for repeated attempts.
Add more advanced AI evaluation for free-text descriptive answers.
Implement timed countdown visible on all devices consistently.
Enhance UX with animations and progress indicators.
